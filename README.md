### Overview

Take a trip to the beach and enjoy a simple Tic Tac Toe game if the water's a bit cold to swim in.

### What I've Learned

- **Command Line**: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
- **Source Control**: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.
- **Programming Fundamentals**: Work with array, objects, event handlers and callbacks, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
- **Web Fundamentals**:  Learn how communication happens over the internet, and how to structure, style, and animate documents within a browser. Also learn how to respond to actions your users take and the data they input into the browser.
- **Browser Applications**:  Dive into CSS and how to use libraries and frameworks to get lots of style for free.
- **Deployment**: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment.
- **Products and Teams**: Document your code and your code repository so others understand what you've built.
- **Data & Local Storage**: Learn to store data in local storage then access and present this data to the user

### Technical Requirements

The app can:

* **Render a game board in the browser**
* **Switch turns** between X and O (or whichever markers you select), Allow player to choose their token
* **Visually display which side won** if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **Javascript and jQuery** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

### Approach Taken

- **Step by Step**: Work on logic and functionality of tic tac toe game itself first. Started with object to hold all variables and methods for game. Used array to hold game board, rather than X,Y coordinates
- **Object Orientated**: Practice with utilising objects to have more control over game functionality and record various data points
- **Data**: Data driven approach, pulling various data points and pushing to localStorage
- **Table**: Implemented footable table library to assist with table creation and interaction
- **Refactored**: Keep code DRY and clean, with easy to understand structure and commentary
- **Github Mania**: Commit commit commit. Commit at each successful feature addition or bug fix
- **Responsiveness**: Work with more responsive approaches to styling
- **Styling**: Simplistically styled, with theme of page to attract interest. Animation and element movement upon scroll
- **User Interaction**: Simple, top to bottom scroll page, with various user prompt buttons to direct play

### Bonuses

* Keeps track of **multiple game rounds** with a win counter, win type, game approach of each player etc.
* Allows player to **customize their token** with color choices.
* **Got inventive with the styling**, e.g. use hover effects for the buttons and small pulse animations
* **Use LocalStorage** to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity

### Unsolved problems

- **Table Refresh**: Automatically refresh table data when game is complete
- **Player colour to table**: Show what colour player chose for game in the table data
- **Customisation**: Add AI capability to allow players to choose icons, as well as colours. Perhaps saving image icon choice in the object, rather than saving just a chosen class style in the object
- **Simple AI**: Add AI capability to play against computer. Simple, random choice type AI
- **Dynamic Board**: Current program has capability to increase board size due to scalable createBoard function, however win scenarios etc, will not work for games larger than 3
